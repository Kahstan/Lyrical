## **Challenges**

- This game was initially created with only "ladders" representing both snakes and ladders, just with different start and end positions. Stretch goal has re-developed the codes to make them individually.

- Randomizing the snakes and ladders in the game has resulted in some bugs. Specifically created some "invisible" snakes and ladders that doesn't satisfy the condition of being a snake or a ladder.

- This game was also originally created as a single player game. 2 players has been created for the stretch goal.

## **Future Works**

- Possible AI for the second player.
